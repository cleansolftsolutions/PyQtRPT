QtRPT (http://www.qtrpt.tk/index.php)

Version 1.5.4

Programmer: Aleksey Osipov

Announcements:(http://www.qtrpt.tk/index.php?page=announcements.php)
License:

For a long time the QtRPT project is distributed under the LGPL license. This license allows you to dynamically link with your 
source code. In order to facilitate the user to use QtRPT and allow to produce statically linking, I decided to change the 
Apache 2.0 license.
License Apache 2.0 more permissive compared to LGPL, I hope that the transition will not create problems for you.
Please note that QtRPT to generate bar code uses the Zint library, which is distributed under license GPL, in this case,
you must use your project is also under this license or disable the use of the Zint library.
